# Subtitle Edit (Tools)

A collection of random tools created to ease the subtitling process

### Tools
 + **FirstLineSmaller**  
   Asks for a font size to make the first line (of a multi-line sub) the input font size. Single lines and lines that
   already have styles are ignored.
 + **UnformatAndCsv**  
   Creates a new CSV file (actually tab delimited) containing `starttime style line1 line2`.
